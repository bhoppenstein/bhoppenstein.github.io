        <h1>Inflation Fears Worsen as Gas Prices Hit New Record High</h1>
        <h2>Consumer costs have soared over the past year, with gas prices hitting a record high in Syracuse on Monday. On Tuesday, President Biden spoke on the nation's high prices, touting inflation his 'top priority.'</h2>

        <p>Prices that consumers pay for everyday items continue to rise with no real end in sight. Rising inflation in the U.S. is changing not only how much consumers pay for necessities such as food and gas, but it is also changing how they choose to spend their money.</p>

      <p>Residents, especially of smaller cities like Syracuse, are paying more for basic items, leaving them with less money to spend elsewhere. </p>

      <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics describes The Consumer Price Index (CPI) as “a measure of the average change overtime in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services,” or, in short, the amount the average consumer is spending on common goods and services.</p>

      <p>According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Figure 1), the CPI in the U.S. has rose about 300% since the Bureau began tracking prices in December 1977. While this sharp increase over several decades is largely due to natural inflation from an expanding economy and more money circulating, the current picture becomes more clear when looking at the rise in costs from the years 2019 to 2021. The U.S. CPI rose 24.6% over those three years, and while data from 2022 is not yet available, trends show prices will continue to increase, or at the very least plateau. </p>

      <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ April CPI will be released on Wednesday this week, with the rate of increase expected to stay about the same. In March, consumer prices rose 8.5%, the highest jump since 1981. With April’s CPI looking about the same, consumers are still looking for ways to save money as heightened prices become the norm. </p>

      <p>A relatively easy measure of inflation is gas prices across the country (Figure 2). These tend to be looked at as a quick measure of the direction consumer costs are trending. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows largely steady gains at the pump until about December 2020. After staying relatively stagnant, from December 2020 to April 2022, the average price at the pump rose almost two dollars per gallon.</p>

      <p>On Monday, fuel prices yet again neared record highs, with the national average for regular gasoline hitting $4.328 a gallon, according to AAA. This undercuts the all-time high of $4.331 set on March 11 by only a fraction of a penny. In New York State, however, gas prices hit a record high on Monday, now pushing almost five dollars a gallon with an average price of $4.348, according to AAA.</p>

      <p>And in Syracuse, gas prices also hit a record high on Monday at $4.434, according to AAA. This includes the spike in March after Russia began invading Ukraine.</p>

      <p>However, as prices continue to fluctuate, the average consumer is left wondering what the cause of these climbing costs is.</p>

      <p>Ryan Magrann, Investment Banking Analyst at Cowen Inc., says there are a number of factors currently playing into U.S. inflation.</p>

     <p> "One of the main drivers of increasing consumer prices has been driven by a significant increase in demand for goods coupled with supply chain constraints making it difficult for producers to keep up with supply," Magrann said. "Material increases in commodity prices are also driving consumer prices higher as oil along with agricultural products and metals have seen a recent spike caused by various factors including geopolitical tensions pertaining to Ukraine and Russia and continued supply chain constraints." </p>

       <p>Looking at the long-term picture, worker wages, despite also rising, are not keeping pace with the costs of goods and costs of living. Syracuse residents are looking for better ways to save and better ways to spend their money.</p>

<p> "This is likely to lead to a decrease in purchasing power for consumers if wages are not able to keep up and this phenomenon will disproportionately effect lower income earners and lead to a further increase in the current wealth gap," Magrann said. </p>

         <p>Americans’ inflation fears stayed around a record high in April, according to a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published on Monday. The survey also said Americans believe the price of things like food, medical care, and gasoline will start to get cheaper in the coming months.</p>

           <p>The Biden Administration continues to make efforts to combat soaring costs, with President Biden speaking on inflation at the White House on Tuesday.</p>

           <h2> <center> "Americans have a choice right now between two paths." </h2> <p> [They reflect] two different sets of values,” Biden said in a speech. “My plan attacks inflation and grows the economy by lowering costs for working families, giving workers well-deserved raises, reducing the deficit by historic levels and making big corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.”</p>

            <p>He added: “I want every American to know that I’m taking inflation very seriously and it’s my top priority.”</p>
